<p>AuScope focuses on delivering data, services, and tools to support the future research of the Australian geoscience research community. As a component of the “Data Lense” of the AuScope Downward-Looking Telescope, the  AuScope Discovery Portal harvests metadata from affiliated data catalogues to support wider access. Over time, it has become apparent that the data repositories offered by the AuScope partners and universities need to be improved for curating data from the AuScope projects. Many do not provide structured metadata suitable for harvesting into the Discovery Portal and offer limited data discovery and retention support. Consequently,  most institutional data repositories do not support AuScope’s strategy toward making data from AuScope projects Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) for both humans and machines. </p>

<p>AuScope is committed to providing a trusted digital repository for its communities (e.g., NCRIS-funded data projects and Australian Geoscience research communities) to curate and publish their data following the FAIR Data Guiding Principles. Datasets will be made openly available through the repository with appropriate attributions to promote open science. The repository is essential for geoscience research innovation in support of the AuScope 5-Year Investment Plan and Australian Academy of Science Decadal plan for Australian Geoscience: Our Planet, Australia's Future.  </p>

<p>This work is supported through AuScope and is funded by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, NCRIS. </p>

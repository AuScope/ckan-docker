<p>AuScope focuses on delivering data, services, and tools to support future research in the Australian geoscience research community. As a component of the “Data Lens” of the AuScope Downward-Looking Telescope, the AuScope Discovery Portal harvests metadata from affiliated data catalogues to support more comprehensive access. Over time, it has become apparent that the data repositories, and more specifically sample data repositories, offered by the AuScope partners and universities need to be improved for curating sample data from the AuScope projects. </p>

<p>AuScope is committed to providing a trusted digital repository for its communities (e.g., NCRIS-funded data projects and Australian Geoscience research communities) to curate and publish their sample data following the FAIR Data Guiding Principles. Sample metadata and links to related datasets will be available openly through the repository with appropriate attributions to promote open science. The repository is essential for geoscience research innovation in support of the AuScope 5-Year Investment Plan and Australian Academy of Science Decadal plan for Australian Geoscience: Our Planet, Australia's Future.</p>

<p>This work is supported by AuScope and funded by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, NCRIS.</p>
